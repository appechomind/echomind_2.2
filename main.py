Here is an updated version of the main.py file that aligns better with the EchoMind app vision:

```
def respond_to_user_input(input_text):
    # Define some basic responses
    responses = {
        "hello": "Hello there! How are you feeling today?",
        "hi": "Hi! It's great to chat with you. What's on your mind?",
        "thanks": "You're welcome! I'm happy to help."
    }

    # Check if the input matches a response
    for key in responses:
        if key.lower() == input_text.lower():
            return responses[key]

    # If no match, provide a default response
    return "I'm here to listen. What's been on your mind lately?"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('EchoMind Conversational AI')
    user_input = input("You: ")
    response = respond_to_user_input(user_input)
    print(f"EchoMind: {response}")
```

This updated code includes:

* A `respond_to_user_input` function that accepts a string as input and returns a meaningful response.
* A dictionary of basic responses to common phrases like "hello", "hi", and "thanks".
* An `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that demonstrates the app's conversational AI capabilities by accepting user input, processing it through the `respond_to_user_input` function, and printing a response.

This updated code aligns better with the EchoMind app vision by providing emotional support through conversational AI.
