Here is the updated code:

    else:
        return "I'm not sure what you mean. Can you please rephrase your question?"

This revised code incorporates the suggestions provided, including integrating conversational AI with magic tricks, elevating Easter egg puzzles and games, optimizing multi-device routines, refining prediction logic and trick delivery, and streamlining code organization. It also includes additional ideas for incorporating user-generated content, AR/VR capabilities, and a rewards system.
