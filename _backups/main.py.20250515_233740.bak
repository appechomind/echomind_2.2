Here is the rewritten `main.py` file based on Cursor AI's advice:

```python
import os
import random

# Define constants for magic tricks and puzzles
MAGIC_TRICKS = {
    "trick1": {"description": "Make a coin disappear", "steps": ["Step 1: Place the coin on your hand...", ...]},
    "trick2": {"description": "Make a card appear out of thin air", "steps": ["Step 1: Shuffle the deck...", ...]}
}

PUZZLES = {
    "puzzle1": {"description": "Solve the mystery of the missing treasure", "clues": ["Clue 1: The treasure was hidden in plain sight...", ...]},
    "puzzle2": {"description": "Crack the code to unlock the secret door", "clues": ["Clue 1: The code is hidden in a poem...", ...]}
}

# Define constants for user-generated content
UGC = {
    "user1": {"name": "John Doe", "content": ["trick1", "puzzle2"]},
    "user2": {"name": "Jane Smith", "content": ["trick2", "puzzle1"]}
}

# Define the main function for the magic app
def main():
    # Initialize the user interface and display a welcome message
    print("Welcome to EchoMind's Magic App!")
    
    # Loop until the user chooses to exit
    while True:
        # Display the menu options
        print("Menu:")
        print("1. View Magic Tricks")
        print("2. Solve Puzzles")
        print("3. Create and Share Your Own Magic Tricks and Puzzles")
        print("4. Leaderboards and Rewards")
        print("5. Exit")
        
        # Get the user's choice
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")
        
        # Handle the user's choice
        if choice == "1":
            # Display the list of magic tricks
            for trick in MAGIC_TRICKS:
                print(f"{trick}: {MAGIC_TRICKS[trick]['description']}")
        elif choice == "2":
            # Display the list of puzzles
            for puzzle in PUZZLES:
                print(f"{puzzle}: {PUZZLES[puzzle]['description']}")
        elif choice == "3":
            # Allow users to create and share their own magic tricks and puzzles
            pass  # TO DO: Implement user-generated content feature
        elif choice == "4":
            # Display the leaderboards and rewards for completed activities
            pass  # TO DO: Implement leaderboards and rewards feature
        elif choice == "5":
            # Exit the app
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            # Invalid input, display an error message
            print("Invalid input. Please try again.")

# Call the main function to start the magic app
main()
```

This rewritten `main.py` file incorporates both LLaMA3's and Cursor AI's insights and recommendations for improving EchoMind's Magic App. The code includes a menu-driven interface, user-generated content feature, leaderboards and rewards system, and error handling mechanisms.

Note that some features, such as user-generated content creation and sharing, leaderboards and rewards, are currently marked as "TO DO" and will require additional implementation to complete the app.
