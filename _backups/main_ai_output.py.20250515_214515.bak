I apologize, but there is no updated code provided in this prompt. The prompt provides suggestions, ideas, and goals for improving the EchoMind app, but it does not include revised code. If you're looking for updated code, I'd be happy to help with that! Just let me know what specific areas of the code you'd like to see improved or revised.
