**Revised Prompt:**

As a prompt engineer working on EchoMind, I aim to further develop the `main.py` file by incorporating magic trick frameworks, Easter egg puzzles, hidden code unlocks, and other features that align with the app's goals. The revised prompt should:

1. **Integrate pre-built magic trick frameworks** for card tricks, coin tricks, or other illusions to increase the variety of experiences available within the app.
2. **Implement challenging and clever Easter egg puzzles** that users can discover through creative interactions with the app, such as gesture-based puzzles or voice-controlled challenges.
3. **Incorporate a storyline or narrative** to hidden code unlocks, where users must complete tasks or solve puzzles to progress through the story and encourage continued exploration and engagement.
4. **Enhance the `respond_to_user_input` function** by incorporating more advanced language processing techniques, such as context-aware responses, personalized storytelling, emotional intelligence, humor, and pop culture references.
5. **Develop a seamless multi-device routine framework** that allows users to create complex and impressive magic tricks integrating multiple devices and sensors.

**New Questions:**

1. How do you envision implementing the storyline or narrative for hidden code unlocks?
2. Can you suggest specific advanced language processing techniques to incorporate into the `respond_to_user_input` function?
3. What are some potential gesture-based Easter egg puzzles that would align with the EchoMind app's goals and provide a seamless user experience?

**Revised Code:**

```python
import magic_trick_frameworks as mtf
import easter_egg_puzzles as eep

# Define a basic conversational AI component
def respond_to_user_input(user_input):
    # Use LLaMA3, Cursor, or ChatGPT for language processing and generation
    response = generate_response(user_input)
    return response

# Integrate pre-built magic trick frameworks
mtf.init_magic_trick_frameworks()
mtf.create_card_trick("Magic Card Trick")
mtf.create_coin_trick("Coin Trick")

# Implement hidden puzzles or games (Easter eggs)
eep.init_easter_egg_puzzles()
eep.create_hidden_puzzle("Puzzle 1")
eep.create_hidden_game("Game 1")

# Incorporate unlockable features or hidden content within the code
def unlock_secret_feature():
    # Use QR codes, voice commands, or touch inputs to unlock features
    return "Unlock successful!"

# Enhance the `respond_to_user_input` function for more personalized and engaging responses
def enhanced_response(user_input):
    # Use emotional intelligence, humor, and pop culture references
    response = generate_response(user_input)
    return response

# Define a seamless multi-device routine
def create_seamless_routine(device1, device2):
    # Use touch, audio, or QR codes to control devices seamlessly
    return "Routine created!"

# Provide tools for modern mentalists (prediction logic, trick delivery, and interaction control mechanisms)
def predict_user_choice(user_input):
    # Use machine learning models or statistical analysis for prediction
    return "Prediction made!"

# Optimize the `respond_to_user_input` function for LLaMA3, Cursor, or ChatGPT
def optimize_response(user_input):
    # Use language patterns, idioms, and conversational flows specific to each AI model
    return "Optimized response!"
