Here is the updated code:

```
import re
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def respond_to_user_input(input_text):
    # Define some basic responses
    responses = {
        "hello": "Hello there! How are you feeling today?",
        "hi": "Hi! It's great to chat with you. What's on your mind?",
        "thanks": "You're welcome! I'm happy to help."
    }

    # Convert input text to lowercase and lemmatize
    input_text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', input_text).lower()
    input_text = lemmatizer.lemmatize(input_text)

    # Check if the input matches a response
    for key in responses:
        if key.lower() == input_text:
            return responses[key]

    # If no match, provide a default response
    return "I'm here to listen. What's been on your mind lately?"

def conversational_flow():
    print('EchoMind Conversational AI')
    user_input = input("You: ")
    response = respond_to_user_input(user_input)
    print(f"EchoMind: {response}")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        response = respond_to_user_input(user_input)
        print(f"EchoMind: {response}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    conversational_flow()
```

This updated code includes:

* A `conversational_flow` function that allows for multiple exchanges between the user and the AI, enabling more complex conversations.
* The `respond_to_user_input` function has been modified to use a regular expression to remove non-alphanumeric characters from the input text and then convert it to lowercase. It also uses NLTK's lemmatizer to reduce words to their base form.
* The `conversational_flow` function now enters a loop that continues until the user decides to stop chatting, allowing for a more natural conversation flow.
