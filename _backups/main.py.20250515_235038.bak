This rewritten `main.py` file incorporates both LLaMA3's and Cursor AI's insights and recommendations for improving EchoMind's Magic App. The code includes a menu-driven interface, user-generated content feature, leaderboards and rewards system, and error handling mechanisms.

Note that some features, such as user-generated content creation and sharing, leaderboards and rewards, are currently marked as "TO DO" and will require additional implementation to complete the app.
