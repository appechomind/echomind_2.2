Here is the updated content:

**Revised Prompt:**

The goal is to further develop the `main.py` file by incorporating magic trick frameworks, Easter egg puzzles, hidden code unlocks, and other features that align with the EchoMind app's goals. The revised prompt should:

1. Integrate pre-built magic trick frameworks for card tricks, coin tricks, or other illusions.
2. Implement hidden puzzles or games (Easter eggs) that users can discover by interacting with the app in specific ways (e.g., using a certain gesture or phrase).
3. Incorporate unlockable features or hidden content within the code that users can access by solving puzzles, completing tasks, or achieving specific milestones.
4. Enhance the `respond_to_user_input` function to provide more personalized and engaging responses, incorporating emotional intelligence, humor, and pop culture references.

**New Questions:**

1. How do you envision integrating magic trick frameworks into the `main.py` file?
2. Can you suggest specific Easter egg puzzles that would align with the EchoMind app's goals and provide a seamless user experience?
3. What are some potential hidden code unlocks that could be incorporated within the `main.py` file to enhance user engagement?

**Revised Code:**

```python
import magic_trick_frameworks as mtf
import easter_egg_puzzles as eep

# Define a basic conversational AI component
def respond_to_user_input(user_input):
    # Use LLaMA3, Cursor, or ChatGPT for language processing and generation
    response = generate_response(user_input)
    return response

# Integrate pre-built magic trick frameworks
mtf.init_magic_trick_frameworks()
mtf.create_card_trick("Magic Card Trick")
mtf.create_coin_trick("Coin Trick")

# Implement hidden puzzles or games (Easter eggs)
eep.init_easter_egg_puzzles()
eep.create_hidden_puzzle("Puzzle 1")
eep.create_hidden_game("Game 1")

# Incorporate unlockable features or hidden content within the code
def unlock_secret_feature():
    # Use QR codes, voice commands, or touch inputs to unlock features
    return "Unlock successful!"

# Enhance the `respond_to_user_input` function for more personalized and engaging responses
def enhanced_response(user_input):
    # Use emotional intelligence, humor, and pop culture references
    response = generate_response(user_input)
    return response

# Define a seamless multi-device routine
def create_seamless_routine(device1, device2):
    # Use touch, audio, or QR codes to control devices seamlessly
    return "Routine created!"

# Provide tools for modern mentalists (prediction logic, trick delivery, and interaction control mechanisms)
def predict_user_choice(user_input):
    # Use machine learning models or statistical analysis for prediction
    return "Prediction made!"

# Optimize the `respond_to_user_input` function for LLaMA3, Cursor, or ChatGPT
def optimize_response(user_input):
    # Use language patterns, idioms, and conversational flows specific to each AI model
    return "Optimized response!"
