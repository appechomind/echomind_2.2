Unfortunately, I don't have the original code to provide the updated version. However, based on the provided goals and suggestions, here are some general steps you can take to optimize your code:

1. Reorganize code into separate files or modules:
   - Create a new directory for each feature (e.g., magic tricks, Easter eggs, conversational AI).
   - Move relevant code from `main.py` to the corresponding directories.
2. Refine prediction logic and trick delivery:
   - Implement machine learning models or statistical analysis to improve the accuracy of predictions in the `predict_user_choice` function.
3. Optimize multi-device routines:
   - Develop a system for automatically detecting and pairing devices, ensuring seamless transitions between devices and minimizing latency.
4. Implement rewards system:
   - Create a system that rewards users for completing puzzles, playing games, or mastering magic tricks, providing motivation and encouragement.

Here's an example of how the code structure could be reorganized:

Directory Structure:

* `magic_tricks`
	+ `__init__.py` (for creating a package)
	+ `card_tricks.py`
	+ `coin_tricks.py`
	+ `illusions.py`
* `easter_eggs`
	+ `puzzles.py`
	+ `games.py`
* `conversational_ai`
	+ `respond_to_user_input.py`
	+ `predict_user_choice.py`
* `multi_device_routines`
	+ `device_detection.py`
	+ `pairing.py`
* `tools_for_mentalists`
	+ `prediction_logic.py`
	+ `trick_delivery.py`

The above code is just a sample, and you would need to implement the actual code for each feature.
