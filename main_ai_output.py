Here is the updated code:

```
def main():
    """Prints a message to the console."""
    print("Welcome to my Python script! This script will perform various tasks.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this version, I've added meaningful output by providing a descriptive message. I've also created a `main` function and used an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure the script runs when executed directly. Additionally, I've included a docstring to explain what the script does.
