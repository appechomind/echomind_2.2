Here is the updated code:

```Python
"""
Project Launcher
================

This script serves as a starting point for a larger project. It prints a message to the console, 
introduces the purpose of the project and its intended functionality.

Version: 1.0
Date: March 10, 2023

"""
import datetime

try:
    print(f"Welcome to {__file__}! This script is designed to launch a new project. Version: 1.0, Last Updated: {datetime.datetime.now()}.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

The main changes include:

* Adding meaningful content in the form of a docstring that provides context about the script and its purpose.
* Using an IDE or linter to ensure proper formatting, indentation, and code organization.
* Including basic error handling mechanisms (try-except blocks) to catch and diagnose any potential issues that may arise during execution.
* Updating the print statement with meaningful information, including the file name and a timestamp.
