Since there is no provided code, I will focus on suggesting improvements and ideas to align the main_ai_output.py content with EchoMind's goals. Here are some potential updates:

```
# Emotional Intelligence
import emoji
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
def respond_to_emotions(text):
    sentiment_analysis = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    if sentiment_analysis['compound'] < 0:
        return "I sense you're feeling a bit down. 😔 Would you like to talk about it?"
    elif sentiment_analysis['compound'] > 0:
        return "You seem to be in a great mood! 🎉 What's got you so excited?"

# Personalization
def set_user_preferences(user_data):
    user_tone = user_data.get('tone', 'neutral')
    user_language = user_data.get('language', 'default')

    if user_tone == 'calm':
        return "I'm happy to help. 😊"
    elif user_tone == 'energetic':
        return "Let's get moving! 💪"

# Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
def offer_exercise(user_mood):
    if user_mood == 'anxious':
        return "Take a few deep breaths and focus on the present moment. 🌊"
    elif user_mood == 'sad':
        return "Write down three things you're grateful for today. 📝"

# Mood Tracking
def track_user_mood(user_input):
    moods = {'happy': 1, 'sad': -1, 'neutral': 0}
    mood_score = sum(moods.get(word.lower(), 0) for word in user_input.split())
    return f"Your current mood score is {mood_score}."

# API Integrations
import fitbit

def get_fitbit_data(user_id):
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    fitbit_data = fitbit.get_user_data(api_key, user_id)
    return fitbit_data
```

Please note that these suggestions do not include revised code snippets as the prompt does not provide any specific code for improvement.
