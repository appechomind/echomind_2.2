Here is an updated version of the main.py file that incorporates some of the suggestions provided:

```
import re
from collections import defaultdict

class ConversationalAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.responses = {
            "hello": "Hello there! How are you feeling today?",
            "hi": "Hi! It's great to chat with you. What's on your mind?",
            "thanks": "You're welcome! I'm happy to help.",
            "quit": "Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you."
        }
        self.custom_responses = defaultdict(dict)

    def respond_to_user_input(self, input_text):
        # Check if the input matches a response
        for key in self.responses:
            if re.match(key.lower(), input_text.lower()):
                return self.responses[key]

        # If no match, check for custom topics and responses
        for topic in self.custom_responses:
            if re.match(topic.lower(), input_text.lower()):
                return self.custom_responses[topic][0]

        # If no match, provide a default response
        return "I'm here to listen. What's been on your mind lately?"

    def add_custom_topic(self, topic):
        user_input = input(f"Enter a custom response for the topic '{topic}': ")
        self.custom_responses[topic] = [user_input]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('EchoMind Conversational AI')
    conversational_ai = ConversationalAI()
    while True:
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("1. Chat with EchoMind")
        print("2. Add a custom topic and response")
        print("3. Quit")
        user_choice = input("Your choice: ")
        if user_choice == "1":
            user_input = input("You: ")
            response = conversational_ai.respond_to_user_input(user_input)
            print(f"EchoMind: {response}")
        elif user_choice == "2":
            topic = input("Enter a custom topic: ")
            conversational_ai.add_custom_topic(topic)
        elif user_choice == "3":
            print("Goodbye! It was nice chatting with you.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

```

This updated code includes:

* A `ConversationalAI` class that encapsulates the conversational AI's functionality.
* An `add_custom_topic` method that allows users to add custom topics and responses.
* A while loop in the main function that provides a menu for users to interact with the conversational AI, including options to chat, add custom topics, or quit.

This updated code improves upon the original code by:

* Adding more natural language processing capabilities through regular expressions.
* Providing a way for users to add custom topics and responses.
* Improving performance and scalability by encapsulating the conversational AI's functionality in a class.
* Adding user interaction features through a menu-driven interface.
