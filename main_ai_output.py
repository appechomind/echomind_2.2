Here is the updated content:

```
def respond_to_user_input(input_text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(input_text)
    
    # Analyze user input and sentiment
    if sentiment['compound'] < 0:  # User is expressing sadness or negativity
        return "I'm here to listen. You're not alone in feeling that way."
    elif sentiment['compound'] > 0:  # User is expressing happiness or positivity
        return "That's amazing! I'm happy for you. What's been the source of your joy?"
    
    # If no clear sentiment, provide a default response
    return "I'm here to listen. What's been on your mind lately?"
```

This updated implementation uses NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to analyze the user's input and sentiment, allowing for more empathetic and personalized responses.
