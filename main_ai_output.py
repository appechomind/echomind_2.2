Here is an updated version of your code that incorporates some of the suggestions:

```
def generate_random_numbers(n):
    """
    Generate a list of 'n' random integers between 1 and 100.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of random integers to generate.
        
    Returns:
        A list of 'n' random integers between 1 and 100.
    """
    import random
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer.")
    numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]
    return numbers

if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = generate_random_numbers(10)
    print(numbers)
```

This code includes:

* A docstring that explains what the function does and its inputs and outputs.
* Input validation to ensure that `n` is an integer. If not, a TypeError is raised.
* An `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which is a common Python idiom for ensuring that certain code only runs when this script (not another file) is being executed.

Note that there's still no actual "main" functionality in the classical sense, as you mentioned earlier. However, this updated code does demonstrate some of the suggestions provided:

* Meaningful functionality: The `generate_random_numbers` function does something useful.
* Organized code structure: The code uses consistent indentation and spacing, and defines a new function.
* Code readability: The variable names are descriptive, and there's a brief comment explaining what the function does.
