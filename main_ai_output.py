Here is an updated version of your code that incorporates some of the suggestions:

```
def generate_random_numbers(min_value=1, max_value=100, count=10):
    import random
    try:
        return [random.randint(min_value, max_value) for _ in range(count)]
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error generating random numbers: {e}")

numbers = generate_random_numbers(10)
print(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Auto-created main.py')
```

This code includes:

* A simple function `generate_random_numbers` that generates a list of random integers.
* The use of the `import` statement to bring in the necessary module (`random`).
* A call to the function and printing its result.
* An `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which is a common Python idiom for ensuring that certain code only runs when this script (not another file) is being executed.
