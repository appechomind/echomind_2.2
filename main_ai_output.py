Here is the updated code that incorporates the suggestions and goals:

```Python
# auto_generate_example.py - A simple program to generate a list of numbers
# This script demonstrates basic concepts in Python programming.

def generate_numbers(n):
    """
    Generate a list of n random integers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of random integers to generate.
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of n random integers.
    """
    import random
    return [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Welcome to the Auto-Generated Example Script!")
    
    num_numbers = int(input("Enter a number of numbers to generate: "))
    generated_numbers = generate_numbers(num_numbers)
    
    print(f"Here are the {num_numbers} random integers: {generated_numbers}")
```

This updated code creates a simple program that generates a list of random integers. It incorporates meaningful content, improved naming conventions, and added comments for better understanding and maintainability.
