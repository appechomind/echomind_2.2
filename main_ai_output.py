Here is the updated code:

```Python
import datetime
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def auto_generated_file_indicator():
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    logger.info(f"Auto-created main.py at {timestamp}")
    print("This file was generated using a Python script.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    auto_generated_file_indicator()
```

In this updated code, I have added:

1. **Create a useful program or utility**: The `auto_generated_file_indicator` function provides more functionality by printing a message that includes the timestamp and a brief description of what the file contains.

2. **Improve the output**: The output is now structured and includes a timestamp, which makes it more informative. You can adjust the logging level to control the verbosity of the output.

3. **Refine code organization and structure**: The code is organized into functions with clear names, making it easier to read and maintain.
