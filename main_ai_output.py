Here is the updated code:

```
def generate_random_numbers(n: int) -> list:
    """
    Generate a list of 'n' random integers between 1 and 100.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of random integers to generate.
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of 'n' random integers.
    """
    try:
        import random
        numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]
        return numbers
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
        return []

if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers = generate_random_numbers(10)
    print(numbers)
```

This updated code incorporates the suggestions provided:

* Consistent naming conventions: I've stuck to underscore notation throughout the code.
* Docstrings: A docstring has been added to explain what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.
* Type hints: The 'n' parameter and the return value have been given type hints for improved readability and static type checking.
* Error handling: A try-except block has been added to handle potential errors, such as running out of random numbers or integer overflow.
* Code organization: While the code is generally well-organized, I've kept related functions together by defining a new function.
* Test cases: No test cases have been included in this updated code.
