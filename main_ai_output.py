Here's the improved prompt:

I'm happy to help review your code! However, since there is no updated code provided in `main_ai_output.py`, I'll focus on understanding the goals and purpose of EchoMind. To better assist you, could you please provide the actual code from this file so I can evaluate its alignment with EchoMind's objectives and offer suggestions for optimization?

If you'd like me to revise your code based on your ideas and suggestions, please let me know and I'll be happy to help! Additionally, are there any specific areas or aspects of the code you'd like me to focus on during my review?

New questions needed answered:

1. Are there any specific goals or objectives associated with `main_ai_output.py` that I should be aware of while reviewing the code?
2. Would you like me to focus on a particular aspect of the code, such as functionality, readability, or performance optimization?
