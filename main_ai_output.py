Here's an updated version of the code with meaningful purpose, organization, error handling, and documentation:

```Python
# Purpose: This script is designed to read a CSV file and perform some basic calculations on it.
# It will demonstrate the use of error handling and commenting in code.

import csv

def load_data(filename):
    """
    Load data from a CSV file into a list of dictionaries.
    
    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the CSV file to load.
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the CSV file.
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
            data = [row for row in reader]
            return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File {filename} not found.")
        return None

def calculate_sum(data):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a specific column in the data.
    
    Args:
        data (list): A list of dictionaries representing the CSV file data.
        
    Returns:
        int: The sum of the specified column values.
    """
    try:
        sums = {}
        for row in data:
            if row['column_name'] not in sums:
                sums[row['column_name']] = 0
            sums[row['column_name']] += float(row['value'])
        return sums
    except KeyError:
        print("Error: Column not found in CSV file.")
        return None

def main():
    filename = 'example.csv'  # Replace with your own CSV file name.
    
    data = load_data(filename)
    if data is not None:
        result = calculate_sum(data)
        if result is not None:
            print(f"Sum of column values: {result}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Note that this code assumes you have a CSV file named `example.csv` in the same directory as your script. You'll need to replace this with the actual name and location of your CSV file.
