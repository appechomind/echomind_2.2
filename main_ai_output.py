Here is the updated code:

```python
print(f"Auto-created {__file__} at {datetime.datetime.now()}")
```

Note that this code assumes you have imported the `datetime` module, which is not shown in the original code. If you haven't already, you would need to add an import statement for `datetime` (e.g., `import datetime`).
