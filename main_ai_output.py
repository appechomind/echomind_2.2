Here is an updated version of the code that incorporates some of the suggestions:

```Python
# Auto-generated script to generate interesting data
try:
    # Function to generate random numbers
    def generate_numbers(n):
        import random
        return [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]

    # Generate and print a list of 10 random numbers
    print("Random Numbers:")
    for num in generate_numbers(10):
        print(num)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This updated code addresses the goals by:

1. Creating a meaningful program that generates interesting data (random numbers).
2. Exploring Python features, such as functions and imports.
3. Adding error handling using try/except blocks to catch any potential exceptions.

Note that this is just one possible way to improve the code; there are many other ways to create a more substantial and useful program!
