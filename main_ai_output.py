Here is the updated code that meets the suggested goals:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("This script was auto-generated for a Python application.")
```

In this updated code, I've added more meaningful content by including a descriptive message about the purpose of the script. I've also used Python's built-in `logging` module to manage and customize the output, which is more readable and maintainable than printing directly to the console.
