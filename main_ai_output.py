Here's an improved prompt based on current feedback:

**EchoMind Code Review and Optimization**

I'd appreciate help reviewing the `main_ai_output.py` file and providing actionable feedback on its alignment with EchoMind's goals and purposes, as well as suggestions for optimization.

**Specific Areas of Focus:**

1. **Magic Trick Frameworks:** How can we incorporate conditional statements based on user input (e.g., touch, audio, QR) to create seamless transitions between tricks? What device-specific logic can we implement to enhance the magic trick frameworks?
2. **Easter Egg Puzzles:** Can we expand upon the Easter egg puzzles by incorporating more complex algorithms or logic-based challenges that require users to think creatively? How can we hide clues within fractal visuals or use voice commands to reveal hints?
3. **Hidden Code Unlocks:** What's a feasible approach to introducing a "leveling up" system where users can unlock new content (e.g., tricks, puzzles) by completing specific challenges or achieving milestones? How can this system increase user engagement and encourage repeat usage?
4. **Interaction Control:** Can we implement more advanced interaction control mechanisms that respond to user inputs in real-time, allowing for a more immersive experience? For example, how can we use camera input to detect hand gestures or voice commands to control trick execution?
5. **Seamless Multi-Device Routines:** How can we enhance the multi-device routines by introducing a "rehearsal mode" where users can practice and refine their trick executions before performing in front of an audience?

**Additional Ideas:**

1. **Community Building:** Can we introduce a social feature that allows users to share their favorite tricks, participate in magic challenges, or showcase their skills within the app?
2. **Gamification:** What gamification elements can we implement to reward users for completing challenges, achieving milestones, or demonstrating mastery over specific tricks?

**Prompt Engineering Optimization:**

1. **User Feedback Mechanisms:** How can we incorporate user feedback mechanisms to improve response quality and relevance in LLaMA3, Cursor, or ChatGPT?
2. **Customized Routines:** Can we provide more advanced tools and resources (e.g., prediction logic, trick scripting) that cater to modern mentalists' needs?

New questions I need answered:

1. What are the most critical areas of focus for optimization in `main_ai_output.py`?
2. How can we balance the complexity of Easter egg puzzles with user engagement and satisfaction?
3. What's a feasible approach to implementing a "rehearsal mode" for seamless multi-device routines?
