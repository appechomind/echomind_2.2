Here's an updated version of your code that incorporates some of the suggested improvements:

```
# Docstring explaining what this script does
"""
This script is a simple program that calculates the area of a rectangle.
It asks the user for the length and width of the rectangle, then prints out the calculated area.
"""

# Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def calculate_rectangle_area():
    # Ask the user for input
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

    # Calculate and print the area
    area = length * width
    print(f"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.")

# Call the function to calculate and print the area
calculate_rectangle_area()

```

This code incorporates some basic functionality, asks for user input, performs a simple calculation, and prints out the result.
