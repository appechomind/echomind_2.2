Here's the updated code:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

def generate_project_structure():
    try:
        # Get the current date and time
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")

        # Create a new directory for the project with the timestamp as its name
        project_dir = f"Project_{timestamp}"
        os.mkdir(project_dir)

        # Create subdirectories for the project
        subdirs = ["src", "tests", "docs"]
        for subdir in subdirs:
            os.mkdir(f"{project_dir}/{subdir}")

        print("Project structure created successfully!")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_project_structure()
```

This code creates a project structure with three subdirectories (`src`, `tests`, and `docs`) using the current date and time as its name.
