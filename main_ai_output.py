Here is the updated code:

```python
# hello_world.py

"""
A simple "Hello, world!" program in Python.
"""

def print_hello():
    try:
        print("Hello, world!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

print_hello()
```

I made the following changes:

1. Renamed the file to `hello_world.py` to reflect its purpose.
2. Added a docstring explaining what the script does.
3. Created a simple function `print_hello()` that prints "Hello, world!" with error handling using a `try`-`except` block.
4. Replaced the original printed message with a more meaningful and informative one.

This updated code is still very basic, but it demonstrates some of the suggested improvements.
