Here is an updated version of the main.py file that incorporates some of the suggestions and goals mentioned earlier:

```
import nltk
from textblob import TextBlob
import random

def respond_to_user_input(input_text):
    # Define a dictionary with basic responses
    basic_responses = {
        "hello": ["Hello there! How are you feeling today?", "Hi! It's great to chat with you. What's on your mind?"],
        "hi": ["Hi! It's great to chat with you. What's on your mind?", "Hey, how can I help you today?"],
        "thanks": ["You're welcome! I'm happy to help.", "No problem at all! How else can I assist you?"],
    }

    # Define a dictionary with empathetic responses
    empathetic_responses = {
        "i am sad": ["I'm so sorry to hear that. What's been going on lately?", "That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to support you?"],
        "i am happy": ["Yay! That's great to hear! Can you tell me more about what's making you feel that way?", "That's awesome! How did you achieve that feeling?"],
    }

    # Tokenize the input text
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(input_text)

    # Check if the input matches a basic response
    for key in basic_responses:
        if key.lower() == ' '.join([token.lower() for token in tokens]).strip():
            return random.choice(basic_responses[key])

    # Check if the input matches an empathetic response
    sentiment = TextBlob(input_text).sentiment
    if sentiment.polarity < 0:  # negative sentiment
        return random.choice(empathetic_responses.get('i am sad', ['I sense that you may be feeling down. Let me listen and offer some support.']) + ['Remember, I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.'])
    elif sentiment.polarity > 0:  # positive sentiment
        return random.choice(empathetic_responses.get('i am happy', ['That's great! Can you tell me more about what's making you feel that way?']) + ['It sounds like things are going well. Is there anything I can help with?'])

    # If no match, provide a default response
    return "I'm here to listen and support you in any way I can. What's been on your mind lately?"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('EchoMind Conversational AI')
    user_input = input("You: ")
    response = respond_to_user_input(user_input)
    print(f"EchoMind: {response}")
```

This updated code includes:

* The `nltk` and `textblob` libraries to enable NLP capabilities, such as tokenization and sentiment analysis.
* A dictionary of empathetic responses that can be used to respond to user emotions and concerns.
* An `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that demonstrates the app's conversational AI capabilities by accepting user input, processing it through the `respond_to_user_input` function, and printing a response.

This updated code aligns better with the EchoMind app vision by providing emotional support through conversational AI and incorporating sentiment analysis to respond empathetically to users' emotions.
