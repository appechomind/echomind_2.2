    # Use machine learning models or statistical analysis to improve prediction accuracy

    # Streamline code organization by reorganizing the code into separate files or modules for each feature

# Additional ideas:

def user_generated_content():
    # Incorporate user-generated content to allow users to create their own magic tricks, puzzles, or games
    pass

    # Integrate AR/VR capabilities to enhance the magical experience

def rewards_system():
    # Develop a rewards system to reward users for completing puzzles, playing games, or mastering magic tricks
    pass

# Open questions:

1. How can we leverage machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy in the `predict_user_choice` function?
2. What are some potential security risks associated with integrating AI-generated content and AR/VR capabilities, and how can we mitigate these risks?
