Here is an updated version of the main.py file that addresses the suggestions and goals:

```python
def respond_to_user_input(input_text):
    # Define some basic responses
    responses = {
        "hello": "Hello there! How are you feeling today?",
        "hi": "Hi! It's great to chat with you. What's on your mind?",
        "thanks": "You're welcome! I'm happy to help.",
        "how are you": "I'm just an AI, but I'm functioning well, thank you for asking!",
        "what's up": "Not much, just chatting with users like you!"
    }

    try:
        # Check if the input matches a response
        for key in responses:
            if key.lower() == input_text.lower():
                return responses[key]

        # If no match, provide a default response
        return "I'm here to listen. What's been on your mind lately?"

    except ValueError:
        return "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?"
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        return "Okay, I'll stop chatting with you for now."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('EchoMind Conversational AI')
    while True:
        try:
            user_input = input("You: ")
            response = respond_to_user_input(user_input)
            print(f"EchoMind: {response}")
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\nChat session ended. Goodbye!")
            break
```

This updated code includes:

* Error handling for `ValueError` and `KeyboardInterrupt` to provide more robust error messages.
* User input validation by converting the input text to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
* A more comprehensive response dictionary with additional phrases and responses.
* The ability to continue chatting with users until they choose to stop the conversation.

This updated code addresses the suggestions and goals by providing a more engaging user experience, robust error handling, and improved conversational AI capabilities.
