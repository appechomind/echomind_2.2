Here's the updated code:

```python
# Auto-generated main.py

"""This script is generated automatically and serves as a placeholder for real functionality.
It prints a message to indicate that it has run successfully."""
import datetime

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        print(f"Auto-created main.py (run at {datetime.datetime.now()})")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```
