Here's an updated version of the code that incorporates some of the suggestions:

```Python
# This script demonstrates a simple calculation.
# It takes two numbers as input from the user, adds them together, 
# and then prints the result.

def add_numbers():
    # Get the first number from the user
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

    # Get the second number from the user
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers
    total = num1 + num2

    # Print the result
    print(f"The sum is {total:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    add_numbers()
```

This updated code includes:

* A purpose (calculating the sum of two numbers)
* Comments to explain what each section does
* A defined function (`add_numbers()`) that performs a specific task
* Input validation using `float()` to ensure the user enters valid numbers
* Formatting and precision in the output string using f-strings
