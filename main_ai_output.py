Here's an updated version of the code with some of these suggestions implemented:

```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    logger.info("Auto-created main.py")
    print(f"Hello, world! This is a simple Python program.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
