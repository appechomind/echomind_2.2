Here is the updated code that meets the goals:

```python
# This script asks for the user's name and greets them with today's date.
import datetime

print(f"Hello, {input('What is your name? ')}! Today's date is {datetime.date.today()}")
```

This code adds functionality by asking the user for their name and greeting them with today's date. It also includes a comment explaining what the script does.
