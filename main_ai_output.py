Here is the updated code:

```Python
# This script is designed to demonstrate basic Python syntax and organization.
def main():
    print('Hello, World!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Changes made:
1. Removed unnecessary print statement as per suggestion 1.
2. Added a brief purpose statement in the form of a comment as per suggestion 2.
3. Improved code structure by defining a function and using an if-else block to call this function when the script is run directly.

This updated script still does not have any significant functionality, but it demonstrates basic Python syntax and organization.
