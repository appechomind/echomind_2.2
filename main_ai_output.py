Here is the updated code:

```python
import logging
import datetime

logging.basicConfig(filename='main.log', level=logging.INFO)

def generate_report():
    """Generate a simple report with current date and time."""
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    report = f"Auto-created main.py at {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}."
    return report

try:
    print(generate_report())
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This updated code includes:

1. A simple function `generate_report()` that generates a report with the current date and time.
2. Error handling using a `try`-`except` block to catch any unexpected errors or exceptions.
3. Basic logging using the `logging` library, which writes log messages to a file named `main.log`.
