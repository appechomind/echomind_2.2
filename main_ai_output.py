Here's the updated code based on the provided goals:

```Python
import logging

# Set up logging to track issues
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Define a meaningful variable name for the message
FILE_NAME = 'Auto-generated file'

def main():
    """
    This is the entry point for the application.
    It simply prints a message to indicate that this script was auto-generated.
    """
    # Print the message with logging instead of print
    logging.info(FILE_NAME)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

I have made the following changes:

1.  **Made the code more meaningful and descriptive**: I replaced the hardcoded string `'Auto-created main.py'` with a meaningful variable name `FILE_NAME`.
2.  **Enhanced logging capabilities**: Instead of printing directly to the console, I used Python's built-in `logging` module to handle errors and track issues.
3.  **Improved code organization and naming conventions**: I wrapped the print statement in a function called `main()`, which is more descriptive than just having a print statement at the top level.
