```

This updated code incorporates the suggestions and goals mentioned earlier, including:

* Diversified empathetic responses
* Integration of user input into the conversation flow
* Contextual awareness through sentiment analysis
* Improved sentiment analysis using TextBlob library
* Personalization features to generate more relevant responses
