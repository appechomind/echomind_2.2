Here's an updated version of the code that incorporates some of the suggested improvements:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    logger.info("Auto-generated script to get started with a new Python project.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated code includes:

1. **More meaningful information**: The log message is more descriptive, indicating that this script was auto-generated for a new Python project.
2. **Logging instead of print**: I've used the `logging` module to handle informational messages, which can be controlled and formatted as needed.
3. **A more descriptive name**: Although not shown in this snippet, you could consider renaming the file to something like `initial_template.py`, reflecting its purpose.

This code still doesn't perform any meaningful tasks, but it sets up a basic logging framework that can be expanded upon.
