Here's the updated code:

```python
# Auto-generated main.py for my project
#
# Description: This file is auto-generated as a main entry point for my project.
# Purpose: It will print a message indicating that this file was created automatically.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Auto-created main.py')
```
