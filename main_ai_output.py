Here is the updated code that addresses the goals:

```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def print_message():
    try:
        logger.info("Auto-created main.py")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")

print_message()
```

The changes made are:

1. Added a shebang line at the top to make the code executable.
2. Imported and used the `logging` module to improve error handling and logging mechanisms.
3. Refactored the code to follow PEP 8 naming conventions and best practices.
4. Added functionality beyond just printing a message by defining a function that logs the message.
5. Simplified or refactored the code to improve readability and maintainability.

This updated code is more robust, maintainable, and follows Python's coding standards.
