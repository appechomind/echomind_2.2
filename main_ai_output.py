Here's an updated version of the code with meaningful print statement, using logging module, adding some basic imports and improving overall structure:

```
import logging
import datetime
import math

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    logger.info('This is a simple Python project')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    print(f'Auto-created {datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")}')
```

In this updated code, we've added:

- A meaningful print statement with the current date and time.
- Basic configuration for logging module to log messages at the INFO level.
- Some basic imports like `datetime` and `math`.
- A `main` function that contains the execution logic for your program.

These changes improve the overall structure of the code, make it more descriptive, and provide a better starting point for a Python project.
