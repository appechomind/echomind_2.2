Here is the updated code:

```
import random
import typing as t

def generate_random_numbers(n: int) -> t.List[int]:
    """Generate a list of n random integers between 1 and 100."""
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise ValueError("n must be an integer")
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be positive")

    return [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(n)]

def main():
    numbers = generate_random_numbers(10)
    print(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code incorporates the following improvements:

* Consistent naming conventions: I used more descriptive variable names and function names.
* Type hints: I added type hints for the `n` parameter in the `generate_random_numbers` function.
* Docstrings: I added a docstring to the `generate_random_numbers` function to provide a brief summary of what it does.
* Error handling: I added some basic error handling to ensure that the user passes a positive integer value for `n`.
* Code organization: The code is still quite simple, but it's organized into separate functions and has a clear structure.

Let me know if you'd like me to make any further improvements!
