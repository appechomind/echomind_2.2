Here's an updated version of your `main.py` file that addresses the suggestions I provided:

```python
# main.py - Auto-generated template for new Python projects

"""
This is a basic template for creating new Python projects. It includes 
some useful imports, constants, and functions to help you get started.
Feel free to modify it according to your needs!

Usage: Place this file in the root directory of your project, then run
it using Python (e.g., `python main.py`). You can customize the code by
adding more modules, functions, or classes as needed.

To use this template, follow these steps:
1. Copy and paste this code into a new file called `main.py` in the root 
   directory of your project.
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., `python main.py`) to see the basic
   structure and imports.
3. Customize the code by adding more modules, functions, or classes as needed.

This template includes:
- Basic imports for Python's built-in libraries
- A few constants for common values
- A function that prints a welcome message

Happy coding!
"""

import sys
import logging

# Constants for common values
PROJ_NAME = 'My Project'
AUTHOR = 'Your Name'
VERSION = '1.0'

def print_welcome():
    """
    Prints a welcome message with the project name and version.
    """
    print(f"Welcome to {PROJ_NAME} v{VERSION} by {AUTHOR}")

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

try:
    # Run the welcome function
    print_welcome()
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any errors that may occur during execution
    logging.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

I added some basic functionality, imports, and comments to give you a starting point for your new Python project. You can customize this template by adding more modules, functions, or classes as needed.
